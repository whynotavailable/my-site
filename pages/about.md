# About

I've been a software engineer working in web development for roughly 13 years. I started in the LAMP stack (ain't that a throwback), and have lived through the evolution of the industry.

This website was written in rust as it's my flavor of the year and I finally cracked it due to the amazing work done in `serde` and `axum`.

The code for the website system can be found [here](https://github.com/whynotavailable/blog).

The website itself can be found [here](https://github.com/whynotavailable/my-site).
